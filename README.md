# Reality Mixer <br/> *Oculus Quest Mixed Reality For iOS*

This is a standalone Oculus Quest Mixed Reality app for iOS that doesn't require a PC for generating Mixed Reality content.

This project is based on the [Oculus MRC plugin for OBS](https://github.com/facebookincubator/obs-plugins/tree/master/oculus-mrc), it uses [SwiftSocket](https://github.com/swiftsocket/SwiftSocket) to handle the TCP connection with the Oculus Quest, FFMPEG ~with Apple's VideoToolbox~ to decode the stream, and ARKit for the "virtual green screen". It also requires [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

This is still a work in progress and it has only been tested on the Oculus Quest 2 with Beat Saber.
